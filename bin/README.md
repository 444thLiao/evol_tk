# Instructions of binary python script

### NCBI convertor
This is a series of scripts used to retrieve metadata of given IDs like protein ID or genome/assembly id.

For retrieving metadata from bioproject and biosample of NCBI, you could use below command

`python3 ncbi_convertor/pid2bio.py -i assembly_ids.list -o metadata.csv -f -redo`

Except for the normally and regular parameters like `-i` `-o`. There are some special parameteters.

like
> `-s`, You could retrieve metadata directly from protein id by passing it.
> `-f` force to overwrite
> `-redo` This script will use some cache for quick re-analysis. You could pass it to avoid some bugs.

The above one is the major one.
Besides that, It has some extra toolkits for extract some other info from NCBI.
Such as,
`pid2GI.py` with proteins ids, it will retrieve GI of its. GI is the unique ID defined by NCBI.
`pid2tax.py` with proteins ids, it will retrieve taxonomy ID of its relative organism.
`pid2genome.py` with proteins ids, it will retrieve genome assembly id and it could countinue pass it to `pid2bio.py`
`pid2basic.py` with proteins ids, it will do all three above scripts staff and combined them into one tab.
`pid2all.py`, beside the basic informations, it will do the `pid2bio.py` staffs.



### Tree for
1. `format_newick.py` is mainly for **format newick** generated by `iqtree` or others tree bulding software. 
    > Options:
    > * `-i`: input file
    > * `-o`: output file
    > * `-r`: which leaf you want to root with? You should give it a/multiple names. It is a necessary option otherwise rerooting would make the sorting failed.
    > * `-f`: overwrite the output file or not.
